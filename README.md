# Health Insurance Cost Estimation
Health insurance can get pricey.
Understanding what helps determine your health insurance costs can help you save money, although not everything an insurance company considers is necessarily something you can control. This is an analysis of which factors determine the health insurance cost using Machine Learning. Four different models where developed for the health insurance cost estimation: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. The model with the highest accuracy for health insurance cost estimation was deployed using Flask.

## Results and Observations

* Smoking is the biggest factor influencing medical cost fees, followed by body mass index and age.
* The insurance cost of a non-smoker is less than that of a smoker.
* The higher the age, the higher the insurance cost value.
